# Medicine Tracker ðŸ’Š
An android application which will help you to keep a track on your daily doses of medicines.
## Problem Statement:

Many a times we forget to take our medicines at the given time which would cause trouble in the long run. Moreover in this unexpected situation of COVID-19, tracking of mental and physical health is the most important task.
 
## Problem Solution:
Therefore to solve this problem students of GDSC-DTU decided to come up with a solution of making an Android application which will not only keep the record of your medicines but will also help you to access your mental health by making you take a short quiz at the starting of the application.

## Functionality & Concepts used

The App has a very simple and interactive interface which helps the students select their route bus and track its location. Following are few android concepts used to achieve the functionalities in app :

### Constraint Layout : 
We have used constraint layout to make our application, in addition to that we have added scroll view over it on the main activity which would allow the users to scroll if the contents overflow of the dashboard. 

### Easy Design : 

The Medicine Tracker application comprises of easy and simple widgets.

### RecyclerView : 
We have used recycler view to display the morning, afternoon, evening medications and also in our quotes, fun-facts activities which are implemented using external APIs.

### LiveData & Room Database : 
The application is using Live Data to track all the medications that are recently added or deleted from the room database.

### MVVM Architecture: 
We have followed Model View View Model architecture to construct our application. As all modules are independent therefore it improves the testability of each layer and enhances the reusability of code.
